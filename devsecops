Sure, here's an example of how to set up an Azure DevOps pipeline for a Node.js application that includes Aqua Security's aqua-scan, Nexus, SonarQube, and functional testing:

Set up your Node.js application:

First, make sure you have a Node.js application that is set up to run on a server or in a container. Your application should have a package.json file that lists its dependencies and an entry point file (usually index.js or app.js) that starts the application.

Set up Aqua Security's aqua-scan:

aqua-scan is a container image scanner that can help you identify vulnerabilities in your Docker images. To set up aqua-scan, you'll need to create an Aqua account and generate an API token. You can then use this token to authenticate aqua-scan in your pipeline.

Set up Nexus:

Nexus is a repository manager that can be used to store and manage your Node.js application's dependencies. You'll need to create a Nexus repository and configure your pipeline to use it.

Set up SonarQube:

SonarQube is a code quality and security analysis tool that can help you identify issues in your code. You'll need to set up a SonarQube instance and configure your pipeline to use it.

Create an Azure DevOps pipeline:

Next, create a new pipeline in your Azure DevOps project and select the option to use an existing YAML file. If you don't have an existing YAML file, you can create a new one from scratch.

Define the pipeline stages:

Add stages to your pipeline that will build and deploy your Node.js application, run aqua-scan, upload dependencies to Nexus, and run functional tests. For example:

yaml
Copy code
stages:
- stage: Build
  jobs:
  - job: Build
    pool:
      vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
    - task: NodeTool@0
      inputs:
        versionSpec: '14.x'
      displayName: 'Install Node.js'

    - script: |
        npm install
        npm run build
      displayName: 'npm install and build'

- stage: AquaScan
  jobs:
  - job: AquaScan
    pool:
      vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
    - task: DownloadSecureFile@1
      displayName: 'Download Aqua API Token'
      inputs:
        secureFile: '<name of your Aqua API token file>'
      name: DownloadAquaApiToken

    - script: |
        docker build -t <name of your Docker image> .
        docker save <name of your Docker image> > image.tar
        curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat $(DownloadAquaApiToken.secureFilePath))" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" --data-binary @image.tar \
          https://your-aqua-server-url/api/v1/scanner/containers/images?imageName=<name of your Docker image>&scanner=nova
      displayName: 'Scan Docker image with Aqua'

- stage: NexusUpload
  jobs:
  - job: NexusUpload
    pool:
      vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
    - task: DownloadSecureFile@1
      displayName: 'Download Nexus Credentials'
      inputs:
        secureFile: '<name of your Nexus credentials file>'
      name: DownloadNexusCredentials

    - script: |
        npm ci
        npm run build
        npm run test
        npm pack
        curl -v -u $(cat $(DownloadNexusCredentials
